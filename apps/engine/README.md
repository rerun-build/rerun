# rerun-engine

A light, self-hostable engine for autonomous AI agents. One process manages many fully independent agents — each with its own personality, memory, skills, tools and API keys — exposed entirely over HTTP. Built on the Vercel AI SDK.

It is a lighter, TypeScript replacement for a Hermes-style agent host: file-first (you can open and read everything an agent knows), with a single libSQL database used only for transcripts and retrieval.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
node dist/cli/bin.js run
# or, in dev:
pnpm dev
```

The server listens on `RERUN_PORT` (default 3000). Health check:

```bash
curl localhost:3000/health
```

## How an agent is stored

Everything an agent owns lives in files under `RERUN_DATA_DIR/agents/<id>/`:

```
SOUL.md                 personality / system prompt
INSTALL.md              guided setup the agent runs once on a new owner's account (optional)
config.json             model, provider, enabled tools, MCP servers, self-improvement flags, setup state
.env                    per-agent API keys (chmod 600, never returned by the API)
workspace/              private root for the file tools, working directory of the shell tool (which is not confined to it)
skills/<slug>/SKILL.md  reusable procedures (markdown + frontmatter), read on demand
memory/<id>.md          durable memories (markdown + frontmatter)
```

Alongside the per-agent dirs, `RERUN_DATA_DIR/shared/` is a global space every agent can read and write through the `shared_*` tools — use it to pass files between agents.

The libSQL database (`RERUN_DATA_DIR/rerun.db`) holds only what needs query or RAG: conversation `sessions` + `messages`, the `memories` vector + FTS index (each row points back to its `.md` file), a light `agents` index, and `runs` audit logs.

## Data-dir migrations

A data-dir can come back from an archive taken weeks earlier and boot on today's engine, so it carries
its own version and every change to its layout is a numbered step in a ladder:

- `src/datadir/migrations.ts`: the data-dir ladder (files, folders, `rerun.db`). The version reached
  is written to `RERUN_DATA_DIR/data-version.json` after each step; a folder without it is v0.
- `SYSTEM_DB_MIGRATIONS` (`src/db/systemDb.ts`) and `SHARED_DB_MIGRATIONS` (`src/db/sharedDb.ts`): one
  ladder per SQLite file, versioned with `PRAGMA user_version`, applied when the file is opened.
- Every-boot reconcilers (`ensureAgentsIndex`, `reconcileConnections`, `ensureForeman`) are not
  steps: they bring the folder in line with today's code, whatever its history.

Rules:

1. Any change to what lives on disk is a new step at the end of its ladder.
2. A shipped step is never edited nor removed. The registry snapshots in `src/datadir/ladder.test.ts`
   and `src/db/ladder.test.ts`, and the per-version `system.db` schema snapshot, fail when one is.
3. A step must be re-runnable (a crash between the step and the version write replays it) and must
   not break the engine still running beside it: `rerun update` migrates before the restart. Add
   first, remove in a later step.
4. A step ships with a test that starts from the previous version.

An engine older than the data-dir it finds leaves it untouched and boots; `/health` reports
`dataVersion` against `dataVersionTarget` and `GET /doctor` says what is wrong, read-only.

## CLI

```
rerun run                       Start the API server (runs migrations first)
rerun migrate                   Run the data-dir migration ladder
rerun agent create --name X     Create an agent (--provider, --model, --key KEY=VALUE)
rerun agent list                List agents
rerun agent delete <id>         Delete an agent
rerun skill list <agentId>      List an agent's skills
rerun doctor                    Check the data-dir without changing it (exits 1 on a failure)
rerun update                    Pull, rebuild, migrate and restart the service (git checkout)
rerun update --artifact <url> --sha256 <hex> --commit <sha>
                                Install a prebuilt release, migrate and restart the service
rerun rollback                  Go back to the previous release and restart the service
rerun install-layout            Write the launcher and the systemd units for the release layout
rerun start | stop | restart    Control the systemd service
rerun status                    Show the service status
rerun logs [--no-follow]        Tail the service logs
```

## HTTP API

All routes except `/health` require `Authorization: Bearer $RERUN_API_KEY` when `RERUN_API_KEY` is set.

```
GET    /health
GET    /doctor                              read-only data-dir checks
GET    /agents                              POST /agents
GET    /agents/:id   PATCH /agents/:id   DELETE /agents/:id
POST   /agents/:id/chat                      stream the run (AI SDK UI message stream); x-session-id header
GET    /agents/:id/sessions
GET    /agents/:id/sessions/:sid/messages
GET    /agents/:id/memories                  POST /agents/:id/memories
POST   /agents/:id/memories/recall
GET    /agents/:id/skills                    POST /agents/:id/skills
GET    /agents/:id/skills/:slug              PATCH /agents/:id/skills/:slug
GET    /agents/:id/files   /read   /raw       PUT /agents/:id/files   POST /raw /move /dir   DELETE   (private workspace)
GET    /shared/files       /read   /raw       PUT /shared/files       POST /raw /move /dir   DELETE   (shared space)
```

Create an agent:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3000/agents -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "config": { "name": "Scout", "provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" },
  "soul": "You are Scout, a curious researcher.",
  "keys": { "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-..." }
}'
```

## Tools and self-improvement

Each agent gets a tool set gated by `config.json`: `filesystem` (jailed to its private `workspace/`, with `fs_edit` surgical edits and `fs_search` regex grep), `shared` (`shared_read/write/list/edit/search` on the global `shared/` space all agents share), `shell`, `web` (`web_fetch`, `web_search`, `download`), `memory` (`memory_write` / `memory_recall`), `skills` (`skill_read/create/update/delete/list`), `self` (`tool_install` to npm-install into its workspace, `mcp_register` to add an MCP server), `delegate` (`delegate_task` spawns an ephemeral sub-agent), `browser` (`browser_navigate` via a windowed Chromium on a virtual display, patched by patchright, with a persistent profile per agent — needs `rerun install-browser`), and `vision` (`vision_analyze` on workspace images). After each run a curator can distil a memory or a new skill automatically (`selfImprovement` flags).

Shell and install run inside the agent workspace with a command-policy denylist. Run the engine in its own container (see Dockerfile) so arbitrary shell stays contained.

## Memory recall

`memory_recall` embeds the query (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dims) and runs libSQL `vector_top_k` KNN merged with FTS5 keyword search. The engine no longer holds an embedding key: it POSTs the text to the UI's `/api/embed` endpoint (reached at `RERUN_HUB_BASE_URL`, authenticated with `RERUN_API_KEY`), which owns the provider key. Without a reachable UI, recall falls back to FTS only.

## Deployment

The engine runs in Docker, one container per workspace, next to the app or on a machine of its own:

```bash
docker build -f apps/engine/Dockerfile -t rerun-engine .   # from the repository root
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v rerun-engine:/data --shm-size 2g -e RERUN_API_KEY=<key> -e RERUN_HUB_BASE_URL=<app url> rerun-engine
```

The app attaches it to a workspace: the first one gets the engine of `docker-compose.yml`, any
other is paired from Servers, in the workspace menu (see https://docs.rerun.build/self-host/servers).
Its data-dir is `/data`: the database and every file of every coworker. Updates are a new image;
the data-dir migrates itself on start.

### Securing a public deployment

- **API key.** Always set `RERUN_API_KEY` (a paired server generates its own): without it the API is open.
- **TLS.** Don't expose port 3000 in clear. Keep the engine bound locally (`RERUN_HOST=127.0.0.1`)
  and put a reverse proxy in front for HTTPS — with Caddy that's a single `reverse_proxy
  localhost:3000` block (automatic certificates).

Docker: `docker build -f apps/engine/Dockerfile .` from the repository root builds an image with
Chromium, the desktop packages and the Codex CLI. Its data-dir is `/data`.
