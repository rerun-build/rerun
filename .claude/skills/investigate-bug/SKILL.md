name: investigate-bug
description: Start of every bug, before any fix. Read the report (a Linear issue, or an older Notion card), gather the evidence, reproduce the bug by every means available, find the root cause and report it with the smallest fix proposed. Use whenever a bug, an incident or a customer complaint comes in, or when someone says "investigate this bug", "why does X happen", "reproduce the bug", « analyse ce bug », « regarde cette carte », « reproduis le bug », « trouve la cause ».

# investigate-bug: understand before fixing

Reply in the user's language. Notes and captures go in `.context/bugs/<slug>/`.

## 1. Read the report

- A Linear issue (or an older Notion card): read it with its comments and attachments (screenshots,
  videos).
- Write down in one line each: what was expected, what happened, who (workspace id, user), where
  (web, mobile, engine, email…), when (date and time), how often (once, always, since a release).
- What is missing from the report, ask for it now rather than guessing.

## 2. Check it was not fixed already

Before digging, make sure the bug is not already known or fixed:

- Search the history for the symptom and the area: `git log -i --grep=<keyword>`,
  `git log -S<symbol> -- <path>`, and the PRs, merged and open
  (`gh pr list --state all --search "<keyword>"`). History before 2026-10-29 lives in the private
  `rerun-build/rerun-monorepo-archive`; what Rerun Cloud runs differently lives in `cloud/`
  (`git -C cloud log`, repo `rerun-build/rerun-cloud`).
- Search Linear (and Notion for older cards) for an issue with the same symptom (done or in progress).
- A fix found: check it reached where the bug was seen. Is the commit on `master`? Is the app's
  `/api/version` (staging or prod) at or after it? Does the customer's engine box run a version
  that includes it? On mobile, does the build in the customer's hands include it?
  - Not shipped yet: the answer is "fixed in <PR>, not deployed to <env>". Stop there.
  - Shipped and the bug is back: a regression or an incomplete fix. Find what reopened it
    (`git log` on the fixed lines since the fix) and start from the old fix and its test.
- An open PR or another workspace already on it: say so instead of starting a second fix.

## 3. Gather the evidence

Production and staging are **read-only** here: read, never write, restart or redeploy.

- Errors and logs around the reported time: PostHog (error tracking, session replay), Dokploy app
  logs, Trigger.dev runs, Supabase logs.
- The rows involved in the database (through a read query, never an update).
- What shipped in that area around that date: `git log --since=... -- <path>`, merged PRs.

### A bug in production: go and look at the customer's account

Investigating on the real account is allowed, still read-only:

- The workspace, its plan, its coworkers, its sessions and runs in Supabase.
- The engine box: find it through `engine_pool.claimed_by_workspace_id` (`engine_host`), then read
  through the engine API (`/agents/:id`, `/sessions/:sid/messages`, `/runs`, `/runs/:rid/tools`).
  Transcripts live on the box, not in Supabase.
- When the API is not enough, SSH into the box: engine logs, `journalctl`, the data-dir, disk and
  memory. Look only: no restart, no `rerun update`, no file edited, no data deleted.
- Read the model and provider the customer actually used before any reproduction, it changes the
  behaviour.
- Never paste the engine API key, tokens or the customer's private content in a message, a commit
  or a Linear issue. Quote only what proves the cause.

## 4. Reproduce

A bug reproduced is a bug whose fix can be proved: try everything before giving up, and see it happen.

- Replay the exact path of the report under the customer's conditions: same model and provider, same
  data shape, same settings, same app and engine version. Climb this ladder until it shows:
  1. the local stack (`pnpm db:start`, `pnpm cloud env:local`): a `pnpm verify:ui` scenario in
     `.context/verify/` that clicks the reported path (`--engine` for the engine of the branch), or a
     failing test;
  2. the engine of this checkout against the prod hub (`local-engine.sh` of the `harness-use-case`
     skill), when the bug needs real data or real providers;
  3. staging, or Rerun's internal test workspace on prod, for what cannot be replayed locally.
- The customer's workspace and engine box stay read-only (section 3): they show what happened, the
  replay runs elsewhere.
- Turn the reproduction into an automated test that fails on the base branch, as close to the
  customer's real path as possible.
- Write `.context/bugs/<slug>/repro.md` (the exact command or scenario, the environment, the model) and
  keep the proof next to it: the failing output, captures, log lines with their timestamps.
- Not reproducible after the whole ladder: say so first, list each attempt and what it showed, say what
  is missing (an answer from the customer, an access, data), and keep going from the evidence. Never
  present a guessed cause as a found one.

## 5. Find the root cause

- Trace the code path from the symptom back to the line that is wrong (`file:line`).
- The cause must explain **every** symptom of the report. If one is left over, keep digging.
- Tell the trigger (what the user did) apart from the cause (what the code does wrong).
- Other places with the same flaw: list them, do not fix them.
- The cause is a vulnerability: stop and switch to the `security-fix` skill.

## 6. Report, then wait

Unless the user already asked for the fix, stop here and give:

- **Symptom**: one sentence.
- **Already fixed?**: the earlier fix or card found (and whether it shipped), or "nothing found".
- **Reproduction**: the steps, where they ran and the failing test, or "not reproduced" with what was
  tried.
- **Root cause**: `file:line` and why, with the evidence (log line, row, capture).
- **Proposed fix**: the smallest diff that removes the cause. A wider refactor is mentioned in one
  line, never folded into the fix.
- **Open questions**, if any.

Save the same report in `.context/bugs/<slug>/report.md` for the agent that will fix it.
